## Instructions

### FOR ROLLED CHASHU
_(Scroll down for the NON-ROLLED version)_

**Before You Start:** Please note that this rolled Chashu recipe requires an overnight resting time of 8 hours.

#### DAY 1
1. **To Prepare the Pork Belly**
   - Roll up your 1 block of pork belly (2–2½ lb or 907–1134 g). If your slab comes with the rind, remove it or ask your butcher to do it for you.
   - Run some butcher twine under the far end of the log. Tie a double knot to secure the rolled end tightly. Leave a tail of about 3 inches (7.5 cm) of twine at the end.
   - Start wrapping the twine around the roll, making sure you wrap as tightly as possible. Secure both ends and cut the excess twine.

2. **To Cut the Aromatics**
   - Cut the green part of 1 Tokyo negi and set aside. Cut 4 slices ginger (unpeeled).

3. **To Sear the Pork Belly**
   - Heat 1 Tbsp neutral oil in a skillet over high heat. Add the tied pork belly and sear all sides until golden brown (approx. 10–15 minutes).

4. **To Prepare the Braising Liquid**
   - Prepare the braising liquid in a heavy-bottomed pot. Add sake, soy sauce, water, sugar, Tokyo negi (green part) and ginger slices.

5. **To Simmer the Chashu**
   - Transfer the seared chashu roll to the pot and bring the liquid to a boil over medium heat. Skim off the foam and scum. Reduce to low/simmer and cover with an otoshibuta for 2 hours, turning every 30 minutes.

6. **To Rest the Chashu Overnight**
   - Transfer the meat to a container or vacuum-sealing bag. Add some of the cooking liquid, seal, and refrigerate.

#### DAY 2
1. Open the bag of chashu.
2. Cut and remove the twine.
3. Slice the chashu into ¼-inch pieces. Use a torch or broiler to sear the slices.
4. Strain and store the sauce in the refrigerator for later use.
